## Story3 Implementation

In NewEnd, users generate their stories on our website and upload them to Story3. Once there, they can explore different twists, choose their preferred narrative path, and even create their own twists. It's a dynamic and interactive platform, putting storytelling control directly in the hands of our users.

## Track and Analyze with Story3 API

Track and analyze all your stories in one place with the help of Story3 API. Gain insights into click rates and popular twists on stories to enhance your storytelling experience.

## Extreme Flexibility in creating stories

NewEnd GenMode allows users to create stories with n-number of levels and twists. Users can provide additional information to explore new endings for their favorite movies, series, and even fictional books.

The branch starts at the root, and every node is a twist. The leaf node is the unique ending for each decision. Through Pre-Order Traversal, a precise template is created and fed to OpenAI to generate immersive stories with infinite possibilities.

## Future of NewEnd

### Integration of 3rd Party Applications

We plan to integrate other applications like Reddit, X.com to get inspiration and suggestions from other users and feed it back to OpenAI to create unimaginable endings.

### Collaborate and Community Discussion

Facilitate community collaboration by allowing multiple twists and community discussions under stories. Better understand the viewers and add more twists to existing stories based on community feedback.
